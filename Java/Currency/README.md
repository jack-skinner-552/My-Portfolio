## Description

The Currency Conversion Project is a Java program that takes a dollar amount as input and converts it to another currency based on the user's choice. It uses predefined conversion rates for different currencies, such as Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), and Mongolian Tugrik (MNT).

The project consists of two Java files:
- `Currencies.java`: Contains the conversion rates for different currencies.
- `Main.java`: Implements the main program logic for currency conversion.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java and a Java development environment installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

To run the program:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Compile the `Main.java` file:
```sh
javac Main.java
```
3. Run the compiled program:
```sh
java Main
```
4. Follow the prompts to enter the dollar amount and the currency type for conversion.
