# Python Folder

## Doom_Style_Game

## hello-world-docker
A basic example of a web application built using the Flask framework in Python to be deployed using Docker.

## JackRansomware
This folder contains two .zip files that contain python programs "ransomware.py" and "decrypt.py". Message the owner of the repo for the password to unzip the files.

Running the ransomware.py file will check the current directory for a file called "sonicthehedgehog.txt". If that file is not in the directory, the program will exit. If it does exist, it will generate an encryption key and encrypt all the files except the ransomware file, the encryption key, and decrypt.py
Running the decrypt.py file will give the user 5 attempts to enter the correct phrase to decrypt the files. If the user fails 5 times, the files will be erased.

These files are for educational purposes only and are not to be used for malicious purposes.

## PokeAPI
