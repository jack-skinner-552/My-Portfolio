Running the ransomware.py file will check the current directory for a file called "sonicthehedgehog.txt". If that file is not in the directory, the program will exit. If it does exist, it will generate an encryption key and encrypt all the files except the ransomware file, the encryption key, and decrypt.py
Running the decrypt.py file will give the user 5 attempts to enter the correct phrase to decrypt the files. If the user fails 5 times, the files will be erased.
